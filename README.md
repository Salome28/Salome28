- 👋 Hi, I’m @Salome28
- 👀 I’m interested in languages, Python and traveling.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Natural Language processing and Data Science.
- 👩🏽‍💻 My current specialty lies in working with Large Language Models (LLMs), a field I am passionate about due to its versatility and the wide range of models available. So far, I have primarily worked with BERT and RoBERTa, but I am eager to expand my expertise by exploring other leading LLMs such as LLaMA, GPT, and Falcon. My experience includes tasks like text classification, sentiment analysis, text generation, and chatbot development, and I look forward to furthering my skills in this exciting area.

More about me : 
- 🇫🇷 I am originally from Paris but I have lived in Helsinki, Washington D.C and Miami.
- 🌍 Travelling is my main passion, and I adore discovering new cultures and talking with people in their native languages. 
- 💙 Mountains are my favorite type of landscape, I find them so peaceful and majestic. 
- 🎧 Music plays a big role in my personal development : my favourite song at the moment is ["Comme les autres"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lz0kbJ5W45o) by Saintard.

I hope we can collaborate together someday !

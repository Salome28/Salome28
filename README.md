- 👋 Hi, I’m @Salome28
- 👀 I’m interested in languages, Python and traveling.
- 🌱 I’m evolving in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and AI.
- 👩🏽‍💻 My specialty lies in Large Language Models (LLMs), a field I am deeply passionate about due to its versatility and the vast range of applications available. As an NLP engineer, I focus on developing tools powered by LLMs to benefit society, with a particular emphasis on security and fact-checking. I advocate for AI not only as a fun and innovative technology but also as a force for moral and ethical good.

More about me : 
- 🇫🇷 I am originally from Paris but I have lived in Helsinki, Washington D.C and Miami.
- 🎧 Music plays a big role in my personal development : check out [my musical data analysis using NLP](https://medium.com/@salomenkb/baby-one-more-time-the-same-old-baby-through-the-years-uncovering-music-s-most-enduring-word-8534b1ae4c25) to explore the evolution of lyrics over the decades.
- 🌍 Travelling is my main passion, and I adore discovering new cultures and talking with people in their native languages. 
- 💙 Mountains are my favorite type of landscape, I find them so peaceful and majestic. 

Would love to connect and exchange if you're into NLP and AI too :)
